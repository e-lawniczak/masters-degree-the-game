# Dilligence: The Cloth's Journey

This game was made for the purposes of my master's thesis: The influence of permadeath mechanic on gameplay experience and interaction with the environment.

The game is about preserving in face of adversity. Journey filled with obstacles and different ways you could get past them.

Dilligence: The Cloth's Journey is a 2D platformer. It's short and concise. I intended to incorporate multiple paths to this linear game to allow players choose their own path. Each obstacle can be overcome int more than one way.
